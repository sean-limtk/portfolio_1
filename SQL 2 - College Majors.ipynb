    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- This case study is based on FiveThirtyEight's article [\"The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major\" ](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) published in 2014.\n",
    "- For many American college students, enrolling in a degree often invovles taking on student debt, but a wrong choice of college degree could leave them worse off than if they have not gone to colleage at all.  A [2014 study by the New York Fed](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/09/the-value-of-a-college-degree.html#.VA6Uh_mwLwk) found that the lowest-earning 25 percent of college graduates earn less than about half of high school graduates â€” and the high school grads also had four years to make money while the college students were taking on student debt. \n",
    "- Therefore, we would like to find out if a quantified approach, based on empirical data, could help this demographic make a more informed decision on their choice of college major, from an ROI (return on investment) point of view."

From 2008-2012, [ 50,000 jobs were lost in the coal mining industry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/04/01/the-decline-in-coal-jobs-in-one-chart/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e0c30835897b), and those skilled workers have either been finding new jobs within a related sector such as Natural Gas or have completely changed industries, such as Wind and Solar which added more than 79,000 jobs during the same period of time. <br>\n",
